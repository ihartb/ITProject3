1. We set up the initial topology by running the given AS352 python file, and from there used the 'ip addr' command to set up each IP address as instructed, for each interface. 'ip route' was used to set up the default routes for each host, as well as to match each destination IP address to the correct port. 
2. There are no known issues in our mininet. We tested each possible combination of pings and traceroutes between hosts, and have run into no issues.
3. We ran into issues trying to figure out how to actually use the 'ip addr' and 'ip route' commands in terms of valid syntax; the help moethods were not easily readable or human-friendly, and instead we turned to online examples of how the commands were used in order to figure out its usage.
4. By working on this project, we learned how to use VirtualBox and the mininet virtual machines, and how to set up a basic topology of working endpoints and routers that can successfully connect to each other. We learned to use commands in the mininet to manually set up IP addresses of hosts, and routes for the hosts to be able to connect to one another.
